	abstract = {This paper presents a new thermo-hydraulic model for district heating systems simulations, which aims at being a fast and accurate tool to simulate highly renewable networks characterized by fluctuating energy profiles. The main novel aspect of the tool lies in the heat transmission modelling over long pipes based on a Lagrangian numerical approach. In comparison to other existing models, this approach significantly reduces computational time and it increases results’ accuracy. The elaborated method avoids numerical diffusion in the results and consequently allows proper prediction of temperature propagation, especially in case of fast changes of fluctuating profiles. The tool is built following a modular procedural programming approach in order to facilitate the simulation of multicomponent system. Thanks to its modular structure, every components of the system is built with the same structure that is differently declined according to each component’s requirements. In this way, new additional elements’ models easily fit the existing ones.},

To contribute towards advancing the capabilities of district heating design for current and future challenges, this paper presents a framework for automating the generation of static as well as dynamic district heating system models. To illustrate the application of this framework, we present a case study in which the developed framework automatically designs a district heating network for 250 buildings using data input from OpenStreetMap and generates a static system model that is simulated in Python as well as a dynamic system model that is simulated in Modelica.},

	abstract = {District heating and cooling (DHC) networks, and in particular, the ﬁfth generation of DHC networks, offer great potential in increasing the overall system efﬁciency and reducing CO2 emissions in the heating and cooling of urban districts. Due to the growing complexity of these energy systems, the use of new planning methods, such as the use of dynamic simulation models based on Modelica, becomes more important. However, especially with large, complex thermal networks, there is a high effort for manual model construction and parameterization. For this reason, we present a framework for automated model generation of DHC networks based on simulation models in Modelica written in Python. The core function of the Python framework is to transform a graph representation of a district heating network into a dynamic simulation model. The authors brieﬂy describe the workﬂow and demonstrate its applicability with three different use cases. We investigate the impact of different design decisions, e.g., comparing the difference between central and decentral pumps as well as a combination of both in one network. In addition, we present the results of evaluating the impact of different network temperature levels or pipe insulation compared to the overall energy supplied to the network, leading to the conclusion that the presented framework is capable of reducing the manual effort for performing DHC network simulations with Modelicaand allows to easily perform parameter studies in an early planning phases in the future.},
