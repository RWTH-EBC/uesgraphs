"""
This is the script that stores all function of the DHWcalc package.
It is not meant to be executed on its own, but rather a toolbox for building
small scripts. Examples are given in OpenDHW/Examples.

OpenDHW is mostly built on Pandas, a good introduction is given here:
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html

OpenDHW_Utilities stores a few other functions that do not generate DHW 
Timeseries directly, like the StorageLoad Function.
