# Hydraulic Network Sizing in UESGraphs

**A physics-based approach for automated mass flow calculation and pipe sizing in district heating networks.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
import uesgraphs.systemmodels.utilities as sysm_ut

# Size your network in one command
sized_graph = sysm_ut.size_hydronic_network(
    graph=your_graph,
    catalog="isoplus",  # Pipe manufacturer catalog
    dT_attribute="dT_Network",  # Temperature difference attribute
    network_type="heating"
)
```

## üìã Prerequisites

Your graph needs these node attributes:
- **`input_heat`**: Thermal demand [W] at each consumer node
- **`dT_Network`**: Temperature difference [K] between supply and return
- **`is_supply_heating`**: Boolean flag to identify supply nodes

## üîß How it Works

### 1. **Demand-Based Mass Flow Calculation**
   
The system calculates mass flows starting at consumer nodes using the fundamental equation:

```
m_flow = Q / (cp * ŒîT)
```

Where:
- **Q**: Thermal load [W]
- **cp**: Specific heat capacity (4184 J/kg¬∑K for water)
- **ŒîT**: Temperature difference [K]

### 2. **Flow Path Aggregation**

Mass flows are aggregated backward through the network:
- Identifies all supply-to-demand paths
- Accumulates flows along each path
- Applies maximum flow principle for robust sizing

### 3. **Catalog-Based Pipe Selection**

Matches calculated flows to real pipe diameters:
- Uses manufacturer catalogs (e.g., Isoplus)
- Selects next larger pipe if no exact match
- Adds `DN` (nominal diameter) and `diameter` [m] attributes to edges

## üìö Core Functions

### Mass Flow Calculation

```python
# Calculate mass flows based on demand
graph = sysm_ut.estimate_m_flow_demand_based(
    graph=graph,
    network_type="heating",
    demand_attribute="input_heat",
    load_scenario="peak_load",  # or "average_load"
    dT_attribute="dT_Network"
)
```

**Key features:**
- Scenario-based calculations (peak vs. average load)
- Individual temperature differences per node
- Robust path-based flow aggregation

### Complete Hydraulic Sizing

```python
# Full workflow: mass flows + pipe diameters
graph = sysm_ut.size_hydronic_network(
    graph=graph,
    catalog="isoplus",
    dT_attribute="dT_Network",
    network_type="heating",
    load_scenario="peak_load"
)
```

**Automated steps:**
1. Calculates mass flows at all nodes
2. Selects appropriate pipe diameters
3. Validates results with comprehensive error handling

### Utility Functions

```python
# Load pipe catalog data
catalog_df = sysm_ut.load_pipe_catalog("isoplus")

# Calculate pressure loss factors
graph = sysm_ut.estimate_fac(graph, u_form_distance=25)
```

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Physics-Based Approach
- Respects mass conservation at every node
- Accounts for individual building requirements
- No uniform assumptions across the network

### Robust Network Design
- Maximum flow principle ensures worst-case sizing
- Handles multiple supply scenarios
- Comprehensive validation and error messages

## üìä Output Attributes

After sizing, edges contain:
- **`m_flow_peak_load`** or **`m_flow_average_load`**: Mass flow [kg/s]
- **`DN`**: Nominal diameter designation (e.g., "DN50")
- **`diameter`**: Inner pipe diameter [m]

## üîç Example Workflow

```python
import uesgraphs as ug
import uesgraphs.systemmodels.utilities as sysm_ut

# 1. Load your network
graph = ug.UESGraph()
graph.from_json("network.json", network_type="heating")

# 2. Set temperature differences
for node in graph.nodelist_building:
    if not graph.nodes[node].get("is_supply_heating", False):
        graph.nodes[node]["dT_Network"] = 30.0  # K

# 3. Size the network
sized_graph = sysm_ut.size_hydronic_network(
    graph=graph,
    catalog="isoplus",
    load_scenario="peak_load"
)

# 4. Analyze results
for edge in sized_graph.edges:
    data = sized_graph.edges[edge]
    print(f"Pipe {edge}: {data['DN']}, {data['m_flow_peak_load']:.3f} kg/s")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

- **Custom pipe catalogs**: Add your own manufacturer data
- **Multiple scenarios**: Compare peak vs. average sizing
- **Temperature flexibility**: Different ŒîT per building type
- **Visualization**: Integrated diameter plotting with `uesgraphs.visuals`

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

- Use `load_scenario="peak_load"` for conservative design
- Set realistic temperature differences (typically 20-40 K)
- Validate catalog coverage for expected flow ranges

**Note**: This feature replaces the deprecated `estimate_m_flow_nominal()` function with a more accurate demand-based approach.
