# uesgraphs version 2.0

uesgraphs is a Python package to describe Urban Energy Systems and manage their
data in a Python graph structure. We extend the
[networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) Graph class and add basic methods to
represent buildings and energy networks in the graph. uesgraphs can be used as a
foundation to analyze energy network structures, evaluate district energy
systems or generate simulation models.

uesgraphs is being developed at [RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy
Research Center, Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor
Climate](https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1).

This repository contains the version 2.0. The main goal of this repository is to add and integrate district heating models developed in [AixLib](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib) and better visualization of simulation results.

## Getting started

### Install uesgraphs

#### Installation using conda

For a easier installation process we recommend using conda / anaconda.

With conda install simple perform the following steps:

- `conda create -n uesgraphs python=3.9`
- `conda activate uesgraphs`
- `pip install -e <path/to/your/uesgraphs>`
- Verify your uesgraphs installation by running the automated tests. Go to your
uesgraphs top-level folder and type `py.test --mpl`

#### Manual installation

uesgraphs relies on other packages to function correctly. On Windows, it may be
necessary to install *shapely* and *pyproj* before uesgraphs.
We recommend to download  the .whl
files for installing [*shapely*](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely)
and [*pyproj*](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj) from the
[Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
for your system and python versions. Install both .whl files with
`pip install <path/to/file.whl>`.

One way to get uesgraphs set up is to use a fresh Conda environment by following
these steps:

- Install Miniconda or update your conda installation with `conda update conda`
- Create a new environment with `conda create -n <nameOfEnvironment> python=3.6`
- Activate the environment with `source activate <nameOfEnvironment>` on Linux
or `activate <nameOfEnvironment>` on Windows
- Clone uesgraphs with `git clone https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/uesgraphs.git`
- Install uesgraphs with `pip install -e <path/to/your/uesgraphs>`
- Verify your uesgraphs installation by running the automated tests. Go to your
uesgraphs top-level folder and type `py.test --mpl`

### Usage

You can assemble a graph of an urban energy system by adding buildings, network
nodes and edges to an `UESGraph` object. The following code builds a heating
network from one building to another, connected via one network node:

```Python
import uesgraphs as ug
from shapely.geometry import Point

graph = ug.UESGraph()

supply = graph.add_building(
    name='Supply',
    position=Point(0, 10),
    is_supply_heating=True,
)
demand = graph.add_building(
    name='Building 1',
    position=Point(50, 15),
)
heating_node = graph.add_network_node(
    network_type='heating',
    position=Point(30, 5),
)

graph.add_edge(supply, heating_node)
graph.add_edge(heating_node, demand)
```

You can go on to plot this energy system with

```Python
vis = ug.Visuals(graph)
vis.show_network(
    show_plot=True,
    scaling_factor=30,
    )
```

![Example graph](./uesgraphs/img/graph.png)

Instead of building a graph from scratch, uesgraphs comes with an example
containing all supported energy network types. You can create this example
graph with

```Python
import uesgraphs as ug
from shapely.geometry import Point

graph = ug.simple_dhc_model()
graph = ug.add_more_networks(graph)

vis = ug.Visuals(example_district)
fig = vis.show_network(
    show_plot=True,
    scaling_factor=10,
)
```

This leads to the following plot:

![Example graph](./tests/baseline_images/01_district.png)

You can extract single networks into their own subgraph with

```Python
heating_network_1 = graph.create_subgraphs('heating')['default']
```

In the example above, this extracts the first of the two heating networks shown
in red:

![Example graph](./tests/baseline_images/02_heating_1.png)

You can use this graph framework to add data to the nodes and edges, e.g.

```Python
import uesgraphs as ug
from shapely.geometry import Point

graph = ug.UESGraph()

demand = graph.add_building(
    name='Building 1',
    position=Point(50, 15),
)

graph.nodes[demand]['heat_load_kW'] = 200
```

This can be used as a foundation to analyze networks or to generate models.
