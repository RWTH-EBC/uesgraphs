**uesgraphs** is a Python package for describing Urban Energy Systems, managing their data within a Python graph structure, and enabling the automatic generation of dynamic district simulation models. We extend the
[networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) Graph class and add basic methods to
represent buildings and energy networks in the graph. **uesgraphs** can be used as a
foundation to analyze energy network structures, evaluate district energy
systems or generate simulation models. **Version 2** has been updated with the following enhancements:
- **Simplified Installation**: Easier installation with the removal of unnecessary Python library dependencies.
- **Enabled Logging Features**: Logging functionality has been activated for better tracking and debugging.
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Compatible with the latest versions of Modelica and the AixLib package.
- **Improved Visualization**: Enhanced visualization features for better representation of results.
- **Addition of `analyze.py`**: Introduced `analyze.py` to enable simulation post-processing and visualization for dynamic district simulations.
- **Updated Model Template Generation**: The template generation feature for Modelica models has been updated, enabling automation of multiple models.
- **Updated Examples**: The examples for **uesgraphs** have been updated, and two new examples have been added to clarify the use of template generation and the `analyze.py` script.

**uesgraphs** is being developed at [RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy
Research Center, Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor
Climate](https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1).

## :rocket: Quick start

### :wrench: Install uesgraphs

We recommend using **Conda** or **Anaconda** for installing **uesgraphs**.

Follow these steps to install **uesgraphs** using Conda:

1. **Create a new virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create -n uesgraphs python=3.13
   ```

   > **Note**: Replace `3.13` with your desired version of Python.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   conda activate uesgraphs
   ```

3. **Clone or download the uesgraphs repository**.

   - If you're cloning the repository using Git, run:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/uesgraphs.git
     ```

   - If you've downloaded the repository as a ZIP file, extract it to your desired location.

4. **Install uesgraphs in editable mode**:

   Navigate to the directory where _uesgraphs_ is located and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -e <path/to/your/uesgraphs>
   ```

5. **Verify your uesgraphs installation** by running the automated tests:

   Navigate to the top-level _uesgraphs_ folder and execute:

   ```bash
   pytest --mpl
   ```

   This will run the test suite and verify that everything is set up correctly.

For more detailed information, please check the `pyproject.toml` file.

6. **Install OpenModelica and OMPython to Run Examples 9 to 14**

   To run examples 9 to 14, you need to install **OpenModelica** and **OMPython**.

   - **Download and Install OpenModelica**:

     - Visit the [OpenModelica download page](https://openmodelica.org/download/download-windows/) to download the installer for your operating system.
     - Follow the on-screen instructions to install OpenModelica on your computer.
     - Add OpenModelica to the environment variable

   - **Install OMPython**:

     - **OMPython** is a Python interface for OpenModelica.
     - Install OMPython using `pip`:

       ```bash
       pip install OMPython
       ```

     - For more information on OMPython, refer to the [OMPython documentation](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/ompython.html#ompython).


### :bulb: Usage

You can assemble a graph of an urban energy system by adding buildings, network
nodes and edges to an `UESGraph` object. The following code builds a heating
network from one building to another, connected via one network node:

```Python
import uesgraphs as ug
from shapely.geometry import Point

graph = ug.UESGraph()

supply = graph.add_building(
    name='Supply',
    position=Point(0, 10),
    is_supply_heating=True,
)
demand = graph.add_building(
    name='Building 1',
    position=Point(50, 15),
)
heating_node = graph.add_network_node(
    network_type='heating',
    position=Point(30, 5),
)

graph.add_edge(supply, heating_node)
graph.add_edge(heating_node, demand)
```

You can go on to plot this energy system with

```Python
vis = ug.Visuals(graph)
vis.show_network(
    show_plot=True,
    scaling_factor=30,
    )
```

![Example graph](./uesgraphs/img/graph.png)

Instead of building a graph from scratch, uesgraphs comes with an example
containing all supported energy network types. You can create this example
graph with

```Python
import uesgraphs as ug
from shapely.geometry import Point

graph = ug.simple_dhc_model()
graph = ug.add_more_networks(graph)

vis = ug.Visuals(example_district)
fig = vis.show_network(
    show_plot=True,
    scaling_factor=10,
)
```

This leads to the following plot:

![Example graph](./tests/baseline_images/01_district.png)

You can extract single networks into their own subgraph with

```Python
heating_network_1 = graph.create_subgraphs('heating')['default']
```

In the example above, this extracts the first of the two heating networks shown
in red:

![Example graph](./tests/baseline_images/02_heating_1.png)

You can use this graph framework to add data to the nodes and edges, e.g.

```Python
import uesgraphs as ug
from shapely.geometry import Point

graph = ug.UESGraph()

demand = graph.add_building(
    name='Building 1',
    position=Point(50, 15),
)

graph.nodes[demand]['heat_load_kW'] = 200
```

This can be used as a foundation to analyze networks or to generate models.
